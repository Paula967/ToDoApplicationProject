ToDoProject - Test Automation Suite
Welcome to my ToDoProject Test Automation Suite! This is my first project dedicated to automated testing, utilizing Selenium WebDriver and a comprehensive set of tools and design patterns. This suite automates a to-do application, covering essential functionalities with a focus on scalability, readability, and maintainability.

📄 Project Overview
The ToDoProject aims to ensure the robustness and reliability of a basic to-do application by covering core user functionalities through automated test cases. The tests simulate user actions, verify application responses, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines to maintain consistent quality.

🚀 Features and Key Functionalities
The following test cases are included:

User Registration: Simulates user registration using dynamic data generated by the Java Faker API.
User Login: Tests login functionality for a registered user.
Add New To-Do Item: Verifies adding a new item to the to-do list.
Delete To-Do Item: Ensures the deletion of an existing to-do item.
User Logout: Tests user logout functionality.
🛠 Tools and Technologies
Selenium WebDriver: For browser automation and interaction.
IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition: Development environment for creating and debugging tests.
Page Object Model (POM) Design Pattern: Ensures organized and maintainable code.
RestAssured Framework: Integrates API testing for comprehensive validation.
TestNG Framework: For structuring, managing, and executing tests.
Allure Report: Provides detailed, visual reports on test results.
GitHub Actions: Enables continuous integration and automation of testing workflows.
Builder Pattern Design: Used to create flexible, reusable test objects.
🏗️ Project Structure
The ToDoProject follows a modular structure that incorporates the Page Object Model and Builder Pattern for cleaner code and improved reusability:

src/test/java - Contains the main test scripts, organized by feature.
src/main/java - Holds the application components and classes structured by the Page Object Model.
resources - Includes test data and configuration files.
allure-results - Stores the Allure report files generated from the test runs.
⚙️ Getting Started
To set up and run the tests locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Paula967/ToDoSeleniumWebdriverProject.git
cd ToDoSeleniumWebdriverProject
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

JDK 8+
Maven
IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or another IDE with TestNG and Maven support
Run the Tests: Run the tests with TestNG:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
Generate the Allure Report: To view the test results:

bash
Copy code
mvn allure:serve
📈 Continuous Integration
The project is integrated with GitHub Actions to ensure automated testing on each commit or pull request. This workflow runs the test suite, generates reports, and updates the project status on GitHub.

📊 Reporting
Test results are generated with Allure Report. To view them, run mvn allure:serve after running the tests. The reports provide a comprehensive overview of passed, failed, and skipped tests, along with detailed test steps.
